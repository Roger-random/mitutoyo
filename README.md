# Mitutoyo
An experiment attemping to translate Mitutoyo Digitmatic SPC data to USB
serial on an Arduino Nano. Based on information included in the in-box
documentation for a Mitutoyo Digitmatic 543-783B. Also referenced
information
[from this page](https://www.instructables.com/id/Interfacing-a-Digital-Micrometer-to-a-Microcontrol/)
which uses a micrometer instead of plunge-style indicator and output to VGA
which is not needed for this project.
